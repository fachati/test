    <string name="what_is_xbee_1">XBee is a wireless communication module that <a
        href="http://www.digi.com/products/wireless/zigbee-mesh/">Digi</a> built to the
        802.15.4/ZigBee standard. The ZigBee wireless standard can form self-healing mesh
        networks. </string>

    <string name="mesh_network">ZigBee mesh network</string>
    <string name="mesh_network_1">ZigBee is a standard for low-power, short range wireless devices
        based on an IEEE 802 standard for personal area networks (PAN).</string>
    <string name="mesh_network_2">A ZigBee network consist of three different types of ZigBee
        devices: coordinator, router, end-device. Each network has a 16bit PAN ID. All devices
        in a ZigBee network is assigned a single PAN ID.</string>

    <string name="mesh_network_3">\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0ZigBee Coordinator (ZC):</string>
    <string name="mesh_network_4">The most capable device, the coordinator forms the root of the
        network tree and might bridge to other networks. There must be one ZigBee coordinator in
        each network since it is the device that starts the net work originally.</string>
    <string name="mesh_network_5">The coordinator initiates a Personal Area Network (PAN) by
        selecting a RF channel and PAN ID. ZC also allows routers and end-devices to join the
        PAN. It is able to store information about the network, including acting as the Trust
        Center &amp; repository for security keys.</string>

    <string name="mesh_network_6">\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0ZigBee Router (ZR):</string>
    <string name="mesh_network_7">As well as running an application function, a router can act as
        an intermediate router, passing on data from other devices. A router can start operation
        only when it has establishes connection with ZC.</string>

    <string name="mesh_network_8">\u2022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0ZigBee End Device (ZED):</string>
    <string name="mesh_network_9">Contains just enough functionality to talk to the parent node
        (either the coordinator or a router); it cannot relay data from other devices.
        This relationship allows the node to be asleep a significant amount of the time thereby
        giving long battery life.</string>
    <string name="mesh_network_10">A ZED must join PAN like a router before sending any senor
        data. A ZED requires the least amount of memory, and therefore can be less expensive to
        manufacture than a ZR or ZC.</string>

    <string name="device_addressing">Device addressing</string>
    <string name="device_addressing_1">When a device connects to a ZigBee network it gets a 16-bit
        Network address.</string>
    <string name="device_addressing_2">Each device(node) has a 64-Bit Device address. In XBee ZB
        modules, this 64-bit address is a unique permanent number assigned by the manufacturer.
        This is also the serial number of the device. Any data sent from one ZigBee device to
        another is sent by specifying the 16-bit Network Address and the 64-bit Device Address.
